# Show your pride

This small module is to help you add the [pride.codes](https://pride.codes) pride corner to your SilverStripe website.

# Usage

This code will help you show your pride on your SilverStripe website.

Select the preferred pride in your SiteConfig, and the `PrideControllerExtension` will inject the necessary javascript and css in to your pages.

That's all there is to it.

# Installation

Include the pride code with `composer require firesphere/pride-code` and select your preferred rainbow in the CMS under Settings.

This code is not extensively tested due to time constraints.

# Options

You can view all the options on `pride.codes`. This module is not responsible for the actual code loaded, but I fully trust Jack he will do the right thing.

# Cow?

Of course! We include all animals!
